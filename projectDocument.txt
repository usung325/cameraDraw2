##Project Proposal##

Project Description:

    An image drawing software that is referencing frames from either images or video.
    It includes features like brush types, sizes, color, eraser, and flood fill.

TP 1 Update: 

- Implemented drawing system based on images
- Brush size increase/decrease
- Switch from drawing mode to erasing mode
- Switch images that you are drawing based off

TP 2 Update: 

- Improved drawing algo (WAY SMOOTHER)
- Organized my code into OOP (3 different files)
- Included 3 different brush shapes that can be changed for drawing (updates the preview shape too)
- Includes 3 different brush shapes for eraser as well 
- A save image feature with unique naming conventions to keep track of different sessions
- Ability to color (currently hard-coded to one specific brush and color but will be modifiable in the future)
- Almost done writing the flood fill feature

TP 3 Update:

-Nothing working updated as of now.
